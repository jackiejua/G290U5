The interations I made to my unity game where making my player move in all four directions, changing the jump and move speeds, making the environment simple yet challenging, and creating a back wall that teleports the players. 
I used a lot of different game design tools throughout this process. I made sure that the goal was clear and that the rules were simple. However, I wanted to make it more challenging to complete that goal in a more strategic way. That's why I added the sphere obstacles and the teleporting back wall into the environment. It allows for the game to be played easily and clearly, but also makes it challenging enough to be fun. I'm very happy with this assignment, and I learned a lot of useful unity tips.
